# Ergodox For Noobs

## Layer 0: Introduction
I recently bought an ergodox.  Because, well, they seem awesome.
Since I switched to Vim ~2 years ago, I've been working to minimize
how much I use the mouse.  The improved ergonomics seemed like a big plus,
and it looks pretty badass (blank keycaps!).

Additionally, I am interested in learning about lower-level languages
and the intersection of hardware and software (firmware!).
I thought playing around with an ergodox would be a good project
to drive learning in those areas.

For background, I mostly write web application code (think Rails).
I am using an Ergodox-EZ on MacOS.

The plan is that I keep track of my progess here and record
everything that I learn--blog style.  And when I'm done,
I'll clean it all up so it will be accessible as a reference material.
It's my hope that some of the things I pick up will be useful to others
with a similar background.  Lastly, I'm secretly thinking it might be
easier to get help (I know I'll get stuck at least a bunch) from
people who know what they're doing if I'm sharing everything I learn :)

I'm committed to typing this all up on said ergodox, so hopefully
I'll get faster as I go (because right now I'm slooooooow).

## Layer 1: Out Of The Box
The good news about an Ergodox-EZ is that is works right out of the box.
That is, there is nothing to assemble or solder.
Even the keys work without any setup.
(If you have an ergodox that you built yourself,
everything after this section should be the same.)

The default key-mapping can be seen on the
[ErgoDox-EZ website](https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/our-firmware).

The bad news is that I don't like these mappings.
1. There are a few deal-breakers for me.
For example, to toggle programs I need to hit Cmd + Tab.
I found that impossible to do cleanly with the defaults.
(There are plenty other unfortable commands.)
2. Let's face it. You probably didn't just spend a few hundred dollars
on a keyboard to accepts the defaults.  You spend a few hundred dollars
because you want to customize the shit out of it--and build
the perfect layout based on your needs.

So let's get to it.

## Layer 2: Layout Configurator
There is a tool hosted on
[Massdrop](https://keyboard-configurator.massdrop.com/ext/ergodox)
that provides a GUI to design your custom layout.

The tool works well, in that you easily design your own layout.
I spent a few hours right-clicking to create my perfect design.


## Layer 4: Flashing the Firmware

## Layer 5: Initial Impressions
TO DO

## Layer 6: Taking a Step Back
TO DO

Fortuntely, everything is extremely well documented.
I'm confident all of my answers are availble between the
[ErgoDox-EZ](https://github.com/ErgoDox-EZ/docs),
[general firmware](https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware), and
[specific firmware](https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/ergodox),
documentation.
I just have a lot of reading to do!
