# Ergodox For Noobs

## Layer 0: Introduction
I recently bought an ergodox.  Because, well, they seem awesome.
Since I switched to Vim ~2 years ago, I've been working to minimize
how much I use the mouse.  The improved ergonomics seemed like a big plus,
and it looks pretty badass (no keycaps!).

Additionally, I am interested in learning about lower-level languages
and the intersection of hardware and software (firmware!).
I thought playing around with an ergodox would be a good project
to drive learning in those areas.

For background, I mostly write web application code (think Rails).
I am using an Ergodox-EZ on Ubuntu 16.04.

The plan is that I keep track of my progess here and record
recored everything that I learn--blog style.  And when I'm done,
I'll clean it all up so it will be accessible as a reference material.
It's my hope that some of the things I pick up will be useful to others
with a similar background.  Lastly, I'm secretly thinking it might be
easier to get help (I know I'll get stuck at least a bunch) from
people who know what they're doing if I'm sharing everything I learn :)

I'm committed to typing this all up on said ergodox, so hopefully
I'll get faster as I go (because right now I'm slooooooow).
